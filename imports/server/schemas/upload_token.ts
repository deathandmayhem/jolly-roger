// A way to authenticate uploads before accepting them.
// The flow is:
// * client calls Meteor method to request an upload token, which checks auth
//   and then generates an upload token
// * server creates an upload token and returns the _id to the client
// * client does a post to /fileUpload/:_id , and since _id is unguessable, we
//   can treat this as authenticated and complete whatever task was started before
//   the upload was initiated.
