// A simple migrations library.
// We store a single record with the _id "control" in a "migrations" collection.
// It has two values of note:
//
// * version, an integer representing the number of migrations that have been completed
// * locked, a boolean indicating that some node has started (but not yet
//   completed) running migrations.
//
// Some notes on correctness:
// * We insert, rather than upsert, the first control record, so that we avoid the following race:
//   * backend A sees no control record
//   * backend B sees no control record
//   * backend A upserts (creates) control record
//   * backend A locks control record
//   * backend A runs migration 1
//   * backend A unlocks control record
//   * backend B upserts control record
//   * backend B locks control record
//   * backend B runs migration 1 again, even though backend A already ran it
// * We update the recorded version after each successful migration, to avoid
//   the following scenario:
//   * backend A tries to migrate to version 2, sees DB at version 0
//   * backend A locks control
//   * backend A runs migration 1
//   * backend A runs migration 2 but it crashes
//   * backend B comes along and migration 1 has fully applied, but if control
//     is manually unlocked it'll get run again.
